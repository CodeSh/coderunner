This is only a scripts bash to linux.

If you want test a script write:

```bash
# This is only to add some script
wget https://github.com/jarriztg/coderunner/tree/master/scripts/SCRIPT.SH
```

<td><strong>Test any script!</strong></td>

```bash
# This is to run the script.
./script.sh
```

If you want create some script to "coderunner", only you will create a Pull Request with the new file.

Any suggestion only send me a telegram msg.
